# Web Fundamentals
### Web fundamentals practice repository

## About this page
Web Fundamentals is a tool for developers that help to structure and design many varieties of platforms.
From websites to mobile apps, understanding web fundamentals will allow me to be more comfortable with creating multiplatform sites.
Here I'll mainly use:
- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript

These three language will only cover the front end portion of creating application, however it will assist me from studying frameworks and library,
such as:
- jQuery
- Django
- React
- and more...

I shall study more back end portion of application in another repository.

Thank you for checking out this page. ðŸ˜„
